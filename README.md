# coral-collaboration

This repository contains statistical analysis of coral data in the paper [Rippe et al., 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/gcb.14422). The analysis is run in MATLAB and is contained in the file "MarineBioAnalysisv1.m". Note that much of the analysis relies on functions written by Professor J. S. Marron and much be downloaded from his [website](http://marron.web.unc.edu/sample-page/marrons-matlab-software/) and added to your MATLAB path.
