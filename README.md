# coral-collaboration

This repository contains a statistical analysis of coral data performed as part of a consulting project and was eventually incorporated in the paper [Rippe et al., 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/gcb.14422). The analysis is run in MATLAB and is contained in the file "MarineBioAnalysisv1.m". Note that the analysis relies on functions written by Professor J. S. Marron and must be downloaded from his [website](http://marron.web.unc.edu/sample-page/marrons-matlab-software/) and added to your MATLAB path.
